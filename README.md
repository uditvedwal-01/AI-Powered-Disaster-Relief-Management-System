# AI-Powered-Disaster-Relief-Management-System

## Overview

This document describes the machine learning capabilities integrated into the Disaster Resource Management System. The ML components provide intelligent predictions, risk assessments, and optimization recommendations for disaster relief operations.

## Features

### 1. Demand Forecasting
- **AI-powered predictions** for resource demand based on historical data
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor** for accurate demand forecasting
- **Fallback heuristics** when insufficient data is available
- **Daily average calculations** for better planning

### 2. Risk Assessment
- **Multi-factor risk analysis** considering:
  - Stock levels and availability
  - Beneficiary to resource ratios
  - Distribution activity patterns
  - Warehouse capacity utilization
- **Risk scoring system** (0-100 scale)
- **Automated recommendations** based on risk levels

### 3. Resource Allocation Optimization
- **Smart recommendations** for warehouse utilization
- **Item demand analysis** to identify high/low demand items
- **Capacity optimization** suggestions
- **Redistribution recommendations**

### 4. Data Quality Assessment
- **Automatic data quality evaluation**
- **Issue identification** and recommendations
- **Data completeness scoring**
- **Quality improvement suggestions**

### 5. Trend Analysis
- **Distribution pattern analysis**
- **Trend direction detection** (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- **Peak activity identification**
- **Historical performance metrics**

## Technical Implementation

### ML Models
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor** for demand forecasting
- **Feature engineering** with temporal, categorical, and numerical features
- **Model training** with automatic retraining when sufficient data is available
- **Fallback mechanisms** for scenarios with limited data

### Data Processing
- **Real-time data processing** from disaster-specific tables
- **Feature extraction** from distributions, items, beneficiaries, and warehouses
- **Data validation** and quality checks
- **Scalable processing** for multiple disasters

### API Integration
- **RESTful API endpoints** for ML predictions
- **JSON responses** with structured prediction data
- **Error handling** and graceful degradation
- **Performance optimization** for real-time predictions

## Usage

### Accessing ML Features
1. Navigate to any disaster's detail page
2. Click on the "Predict" tab
3. View AI-powered insights and recommendations

### API Endpoints
- `GET /disasters/<id>/predict/api` - Get ML predictions as JSON

### Data Requirements
- **Minimum 5 distributions** for basic ML training
- **10+ distributions** recommended for accurate predictions
- **Recent data** (within 30 days) for best results

## Visualization

### Interactive Charts
- **Demand forecasting charts** showing current vs predicted demand
- **Risk assessment gauges** with color-coded risk levels
- **Trend analysis charts** showing distribution patterns over time
- **Warehouse utilization charts** for capacity management

### Real-time Updates
- **Automatic chart updates** when new data is available
- **Responsive design** for different screen sizes
- **Interactive tooltips** with detailed information

## Configuration

### Dependencies
```
scikit-learn==1.3.2
pandas==2.1.4
numpy==1.24.4
matplotlib==3.8.2
seaborn==0.13.0
plotly==5.17.0
joblib==1.3.2
```

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Performance Considerations

### Model Training
- **Automatic training** when sufficient data is available
- **Caching** of trained models for performance
- **Incremental learning** for continuous improvement

### Data Processing
- **Efficient data queries** with optimized database access
- **Batch processing** for large datasets
- **Memory management** for large-scale operations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Deep learning models** for more complex patterns
- **Real-time streaming** predictions
- **Multi-disaster** cross-learning
- **Advanced visualization** with 3D charts
- **Mobile optimization** for field operations

### Integration Opportunities
- **External data sources** (weather, population density)
- **IoT sensors** for real-time monitoring
- **Geographic analysis** for location-based predictions
- **Social media sentiment** analysis for demand prediction

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"ML Model Not Trained"** - Add more distribution data
2. **"Poor Data Quality"** - Follow recommendations to improve data
3. **"Insufficient Data"** - Record more activities in the system

### Performance Issues
- **Slow predictions** - Check database performance
- **Memory usage** - Monitor system resources
- **Chart loading** - Ensure stable internet connection
